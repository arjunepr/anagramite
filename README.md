## Anagramite

NOTE: Currently, I would suggest using [heaps-permute](https://github.com/dsernst/heaps-permute). Just turn your strings into array using the String.prototype.split method before passing them into the function. Or, you could use the elegant object destructuring syntax on strings.

e.g. [...'lol'] creates an array with each item being a character of the string.

A library exposing an intentionally simple API, to simple [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) related tasks.
